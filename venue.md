<p style='text-align: center'> <b>Ceremony: Zephyr Palace at Villa Caletas, Costa Rica</b> We’re getting married at Zephyr Palace, a quiet villa tucked into the rainforest hills above the Pacific. It’s part of Villa Caletas, where the mountains meet the sea and the sunsets spill gold across the sky. There was something about it that made us feel like this was the place.
It’s our little winter escape - warm air, ocean breeze, and a chance to slow down and share this moment with the people we love most.</p>

<b>Getting there</b>
Fly into San José International Airport (SJO). From there, it’s about a 1.5-hour drive through winding, scenic roads to the venue. Most guests will likely stay in Jacó, a lively beach town nearby with plenty of hotels, restaurants, and things to explore.
We can’t wait to spend this special weekend with you.
