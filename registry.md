Coming to Costa Rica to celebrate with us is a wonderful gift and not without expense, so we want to make sure you know that your presence is the only present we need. I'm not the best at packing as it is, so please don't give us something that needs to be transported back from Costa Rica. - Matt

If you feel strongly that you must give us a gift, we've created a honeymoon fund following with the Chinese tradition of receiving red packets instead of a gift registry. Absolutely no pressure – we’re just so happy you’re here to celebrate with us!
