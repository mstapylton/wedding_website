Coming to Costa Rica to celebrate with us is already such a meaningful gift and we truly appreciate the time, effort, and expense that goes into being there. Your presence is more than enough, and we genuinely don’t expect anything beyond that.

If you still feel inclined to give something, we’ve set up a honeymoon fund in the spirit of the Chinese red packet tradition in place of a traditional registry. Absolutely no pressure - we’re just incredibly grateful to have you celebrating with us.
