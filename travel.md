### Ridesharing ü§ùüèº
Most people's final leg of transport will involve a car. We've set up a [ridesharing spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1o02hOkrnIfmcy2Br_meUX2KkyGG3ZbRqcB4DAKcWdD4/edit#gid=0), where you can see who is going where and when. If you are looking for, or offering shared transport, add your details / contact people directly.

## Travel Options
`
*There are lots of ways to get here, but we think many people will consider these options.*

### By Plane ‚úàÔ∏è

There are two major airports nearby, that have many direct flights per day from London, Paris and other nearby European destinations. Both have lots of car rental options (recommended):
- [**Lyon-Saint Exup√©ry Airport**](https://www.skyscanner.net/transport/flights/lond/lys/220708/220710/?adults=1&adultsv2=1&cabinclass=economy&children=0&childrenv2=&destinationentityid=27544221&inboundaltsenabled=false&infants=0&originentityid=27544008&outboundaltsenabled=false&preferdirects=false&ref=home&rtn=1)
    - 1hr 40 flight from London
    - 1hr 25 drive to wedding venue
- [**Marseille Provence Airport**](https://www.skyscanner.net/transport/flights/lond/mrs/220708/220710/?adults=1&adultsv2=1&cabinclass=economy&children=0&childrenv2=&destinationentityid=32030366&inboundaltsenabled=false&infants=0&outboundaltsenabled=false&preferdirects=false&ref=home&rtn=1)
    - 1hr 55 flight from London
    - 1hr 30 drive to wedding venue


### By Train üöÑ

You can get closer to the venue by train, but it may involve more travel time for UK guests. For non-European residents, this may be preferable to changing to another plane in Paris.

_Please note, train stations are NOT walking distance from venue, and there is limited public transport._

    - Possible good option for those flying into France from further afield (eg North America)
    - 2hr 52 train from Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport
    - 2hr 15 train from Paris Gare de Lyon
    - 30 min drive to venue
        - There seems to be a [local taxi company](https://goo.gl/maps/kYnRsqoHtsyBN99PA). Taxis c. ‚Ç¨100 to venue each way.
        - There are many car rental agencies at the destination train station (Hertz, Enterprise, Alamo etc)
- **Eurostar to Montelimar Gare.**
    - 6hr 43 train from London St Pancras
    - 20 min drive to wedding venue.
        - There are multiple taxi companies in Montelimar. Taxis c. ‚Ç¨60-80 to venue each way.
