### What COVID travel measures are in place in France?

Measures may vary from non-UK origins - check local guidance. 

From the UK, see [current measures](https://www.bbc.com/news/explainers-56997931). You can enter France from the UK if you:

- Complete a ["sworn statement"](https://www.interieur.gouv.fr/covid-19-international-travel).
- Prove that you've been fully vaccinated, and your last dose was less than nine months ago. If you are 18+, and your last dose was more than nine months ago, you will NOT be considered fully vaccinated unless you have also received a booster.
- Since 12 Feb you **no longer need to present proof of a negative test** before you travel if you're fully vaccinated.


### What should I wear?

The only event with a dress code is on Saturday. 

Our theme is *"Riviera Chic"*. Think linen, open collars, sandals & midi dresses.

It's likely going to be hot, with an average daytime temp of 27Â°C, so don't feel the need to wear a suit. If it's a scorcher, shorts are encouraged (we want you to enjoy yourself, not suffer!).

If you want to take a dip in the pool make sure to bring your swimmers!


### Can I bring my kids?

We really do love kids, however the Saturday events will be adults and babes-in-arms only (if this applies to you please let us know on the RSVP). To organise a babysitter, call or text Marlene at +33 6 83 47 46 43. Feel free to bring your kids to events on Friday and Sunday.

### Can I bring a plus one?

Please check your invite!

### Is the wedding outdoors?

Assuming the weather is good, the ceremony will be outdoors. Dinner will be served in the marquee. The grounds are pretty amazing, so expect to walk around outside.

### Who made the website?

Archie, of course ðŸ˜€ 


### I have another question
