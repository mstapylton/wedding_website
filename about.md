The code for this website is available on my GitHub: [Wedding website github](https://github.com/mstapylton/wedding_website)

I used [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), which is a good tool for creating static websites. I took an existing template from those available here: [Jekyll themes](https://jekyll-themes.com/category/wedding).

I host this website on AWS and registered the domain there too.  

I made my project website the same way, feel free to check it out: [https://skolem-squares.com/](https://skolem-squares.com/) **Username:** Skolem **Password:** 41134232
