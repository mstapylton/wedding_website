# Markdown Wedding Website

A simple website I made for our wedding.

This uses [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) which is a Ruby package for turning documents written in Markdown into websites, and [Alembic](https://alembic.darn.es/) which is a Jekyll theme.

I hosted this using Netlify at [archieandanna.com](https://archieandanna.com/), but you could use a variety of different options for hosting, depending on what you need.

## Setting up locally - overview

1. Install Ruby and dependencies:
    - Jekyll
    - Alembic-kit
2. Clone this repo
3. Run `jekyll serve`, and navigate to localhost:4000 in your browser
